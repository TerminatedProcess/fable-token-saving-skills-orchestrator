"""Fail-open Stop hook for short-wait keepalive discipline.

When a waiting sentinel exists, the agent should end the turn by arming a
sleep-tick task before the prompt cache expires. If the sentinel exists and no
tick marker was touched recently, this hook blocks the stop with a concrete
repair instruction.

Environment overrides:
  FTSO_KEEPALIVE_SENTINEL
  FTSO_LAST_TICK
  FTSO_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS
